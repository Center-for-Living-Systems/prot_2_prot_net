Prot_2_prot_net is a deep learning framework for modeling relationships between protein structures through image-to-image prediction. It supports flexible backbone architectures including U-Net and ConvNeXt, and is designed for future extension to Transformer-based models.

This repository contains code to train a U-Net to predict forces from protein distributions as described in [Machine learning interpretable models of cell mechanics from protein images](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)01331-4) ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00176)).
